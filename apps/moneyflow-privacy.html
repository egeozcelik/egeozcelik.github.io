        <h1 class="title1">Moneyflow App</h1>
        <h1 class="title2">Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p class="about">Moneyflow is designed to help users gain financial awareness by analyzing their daily, monthly, and yearly income and expenses. With its user-friendly interface, it provides easy access to essential financial insights, such as daily spending limits, income and expense trends compared to previous periods, and expenditure distributionâ€”all in a single view. The app aims to make financial management more accessible and comprehensible through advanced visualizations and mathematical analysis.<br><br>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Moneyflow ("we", "us", "our" or "Moneyflow") handles your personal information when you use our mobile application ("Application"). By using Moneyflow, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> Moneyflow does not collect, request, or store any personal information, including your name, email, phone number, salary, or expense details. The app operates entirely offline, ensuring your financial data remains private and secure on your device.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Widget Functionality:</strong> Our iOS widget displays financial summary data on your home screen. This data is shared between the main app and widget through iOS App Groups but remains entirely on your device. No widget data is transmitted externally.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Local Notifications:</strong> The app may send local notifications for expense reminders based on due dates you set. These notifications are processed locally on your device and no notification data is shared externally.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of Your Information</h2>
        <p>Moneyflow does not collect any personal or usage data. All financial data and insights generated within the app remain solely on your device, ensuring complete user privacy.</p>

        <h2>3. Security</h2>
        <p>Moneyflow prioritizes user privacy and data security. Since the app does not collect or store any personal information on external servers, there is no risk of unauthorized access, disclosure, or data breaches from our side. All financial data entered by the user is securely stored locally on the device using iOS secure storage mechanisms and is not shared with third parties.<br><br>
        However, as with any application displaying sensitive information on-screen, we recommend that users take precautions to prevent unauthorized viewing by others while using the app. Additionally, uninstalling the app will permanently delete all saved records.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>All your financial data is stored locally on your device. We do not retain any user data on our servers. You can delete all your data at any time by uninstalling the app. Monthly data archiving is performed locally on your device for historical analysis purposes and does not involve any external data transmission.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Moneyflow is suitable for all ages and does not target children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. All data entered in the app is stored locally on the device and is not shared externally. If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns, please contact us at moneyflowdeveloper@gmail.com.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page with an updated "Last Update" date. Continued use of the app after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
