        <h1 class="title1">Trackie App</h1>
        <h1 class="title2">Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p class="about">Trackie helps users build positive daily habits through tracking and progress analytics. This Privacy Policy describes how Trackie ("we", "us", or "our") handles user information.  
        By using Trackie, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>We do not collect or store any personal data such as names or emails. However, Trackie displays ads through Google AdMob, which may automatically collect certain non-personal device information for advertising purposes.</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> Trackie does not request or store any personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or contact details.<br><br>

        <strong>Habit Data:</strong> All habit tracking data (habit names, progress, streaks, and statistics) is stored locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults and Core Data. This information never leaves your device.<br><br>

        <strong>Advertising Data (via Google AdMob):</strong> To support the free version of Trackie, ads may be displayed through Google AdMob. The AdMob SDK may automatically collect:
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA or Android Ad ID)</li>
            <li>Approximate location (for non-personalized ads)</li>
            <li>Interaction data (e.g., ad views, clicks, impressions)</li>
        </ul>
        This information is processed by Google in accordance with its own privacy policy:  
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
        </p>
        <p>Even though this information is considered non-personal by us, it may still be treated as personal data under certain privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). The app developer does not have access to or control over the data processed by AdMob.</p>


        <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
        <p>Trackie itself does not process or share any personal data.  
        Data collected by AdMob is used by Google for:
        <ul>
            <li>Serving and limiting ad frequency</li>
            <li>Measuring ad performance</li>
            <li>Preventing fraud and abuse</li>
        </ul>
        Trackie does not use this information for analytics, tracking, or personalization beyond what AdMob handles automatically.</p>
        <p>Trackie requests non-personalized ads by default. However, users may still receive personalized ads if they have granted consent through their Google account or device settings.</p>

        <h2>4. User Controls</h2>
        <p>Users can control or reset their advertising identifiers at any time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Tracking / Advertising</li>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Ads → Reset advertising ID</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also opt out of personalized advertising in your device settings.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p><strong>Local Data:</strong> All habit data is stored locally on your device and is never uploaded to external servers.<br><br>
        <strong>Third-Party Data:</strong> Any data collected by AdMob is handled and retained solely by Google, under its own security and privacy standards.<br><br>
        <strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all local habit data from your device.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Aside from AdMob, Trackie does not integrate with any analytics platforms, crash reporters, or social networks. No other third-party SDKs collect data through the app.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Trackie is not directed toward children under 13 years old.  
        If you believe your child’s information has been collected through advertising interactions, please contact Google directly to request deletion.</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect or request any personal data from children under 13, and we do not serve personalized ads to them.</p>

        <h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  
        The “Last Update” date at the top reflects the latest revision. Continued use of Trackie after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> trackiedeveloper@gmail.com</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Trackie does not collect personal data. All habit data remains on your device. Ads are displayed via Google AdMob, which may collect limited device and interaction data to serve and measure ads in accordance with Google’s policies.
