        <h1 class="title1">Trackie App</h1>
        <h1 class="title2">Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p class="about">Trackie is designed to help users build positive daily habits through tracking, progress analytics, and informational content. With its intuitive interface, users can monitor their habit streaks, set custom goals, access educational resources about habit formation, and follow pre-designed habit programs. The app aims to make habit formation more engaging and informed through progress tracking and science-based content—all while maintaining complete user privacy. <br><br>
        
        This Privacy Policy describes how Trackie ("we", "us", "our" or "Trackie") handles your information when you use our mobile application ("Application"). By using Trackie, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Simple Answer: We collect ZERO personal information.</strong>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> Trackie does not collect, request, or store any personal information, including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number, location, or any other identifying details. The app operates entirely offline, ensuring your habit data remains private and secure on your device.<br><br>

        <strong>Habit Data:</strong> All habit tracking data (habit names, completion records, streaks, custom templates, selected programs, and progress statistics) is stored locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults and Core Data. This information never leaves your device.<br><br>

        <strong>Content Interaction:</strong> Your interaction with informational content and habit programs within the app is not tracked, monitored, or recorded in any way. We do not know which content you read, which programs you follow, or how you use the app's features.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of Your Information</h2>
        <p>Since Trackie does not collect any personal or usage data, we do not store, process, or share any information about you. All habit tracking data and insights generated within the app remain solely on your device, ensuring complete user privacy.<br><br>

        The app's functionality relies entirely on local processing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Habit tracking is managed through local device storage</li>
            <li>Progress analytics are calculated locally</li>
            <li>Informational content is stored within the app but your reading history is not tracked</li>
            <li>Program selections and progress are stored locally only</li>
            <li>Widget data sharing occurs only between the main app and widget on the same device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Informational Content and Habit Programs</h2>
        <p><strong>Content Storage:</strong> Educational content and pre-designed habit programs are embedded within the app and stored locally on your device as part of the app installation.<br><br>

        <strong>No Usage Tracking:</strong> We do not track which informational content you read, how long you spend using the app, or which habit programs you follow. Your learning journey and program choices remain completely private.<br><br>

        <strong>No Personalization Based on Tracking:</strong> Since we don't track your content usage, the app does not create user profiles or personalize content based on your behavior. All users see the same content library.<br><br>

        <strong>Content Disclaimer:</strong> The informational content and habit programs provided in the app are for educational and awareness purposes only. They do not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Users are responsible for evaluating this information according to their own health conditions and personal circumstances.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Trackie does not use any third-party services, analytics tools, advertising networks, or cloud services that collect data about your app usage. The app operates in complete isolation:<br><br>

        • No Google Analytics or similar tracking<br>
        • No crash reporting services<br>
        • No advertising networks<br>
        • No cloud storage or backup services<br>
        • No social media integrations<br>
        • No user authentication services<br>
        • No external content delivery networks for educational content<br><br>

        The only external dependency is Apple's iOS frameworks (CoreData, UserDefaults) which operate locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Widget Functionality</h2>
        <p>Trackie includes iOS widget functionality that displays your habit progress on your home screen. This feature uses iOS App Groups to share data between the main app and the widget extension.<br><br>

        <strong>Important:</strong> This data sharing occurs entirely on your device between different components of the same app. No data is transmitted outside your device, and the widget data is the same habit information already stored locally by the main app.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Trackie prioritizes user privacy and data security through a "privacy by design" approach:<br><br>

        <strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All data is stored locally on your device using iOS's secure UserDefaults and Core Data frameworks. No information is stored on external servers.<br><br>

        <strong>No Network Communication:</strong> The app does not communicate with any external servers, APIs, or online services. Your habit data never leaves your device.<br><br>

        <strong>Data Isolation:</strong> Your habit data is sandboxed within the app and cannot be accessed by other apps on your device.<br><br>

        <strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all stored habit data. There is no way to recover this data once the app is removed, as no backups are created externally.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Trackie is designed for users aged 13 and older. Users under 18 are encouraged to use the app under parental or guardian supervision, especially when accessing informational content. Since we don't collect any personal information from any users, this policy applies universally to all age groups who meet our minimum age requirement.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights and Data Control</h2>
        <p>Since Trackie operates entirely on your device with no external data collection:<br><br>

        • <strong>Access:</strong> You have complete access to all your data within the app<br>
        • <strong>Portability:</strong> Your data exists only on your device; there are no export tools as no external storage is used<br>
        • <strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete all data by uninstalling the app<br>
        • <strong>Correction:</strong> You can modify any habit data directly within the app<br>
        • <strong>Transparency:</strong> This policy fully discloses our non-existent data collection practices<br>
        • <strong>Content Preferences:</strong> You choose which content to read and which programs to follow with no tracking</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices or to comply with legal requirements. Since we don't collect contact information, we will notify users of significant changes through app updates or in-app notifications.<br><br>
           
        The "Last Update" date at the top of this policy indicates the most recent revision. Any material changes that would affect our no-data-collection approach will be prominently featured in app update descriptions.</p>
 
        <h2>10. Changes to App Content</h2>
        <p>Trackie reserves the right to update, modify, or remove content without prior notice. This includes but is not limited to informational content, habit programs, and app features.</p>

        <h2>11. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
        <p>For California residents: Since Trackie does not collect any personal information, CCPA rights regarding access, deletion, and sale of personal information are not applicable. We have no personal information to access, delete, or sell.</p>

        <h2>12. European Data Protection (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>For European Union residents: Since Trackie does not collect any personal data as defined by GDPR, the regulation's requirements regarding data processing, consent, and user rights do not apply. We are not a data controller or processor because we do not handle any personal data.</p>

        <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
