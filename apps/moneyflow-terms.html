        <p>Welcome to Moneyflow!</p>
        <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Moneyflow mobile application ("App") and related services provided by Indigo Cats Team.</p>

        <h2>2. App Access and Features</h2>
        <p>Moneyflow is a paid mobile application for personal finance tracking and management. All features are included in the initial purchase of the app.</p>

        <h2>3. Data and Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your use of Moneyflow is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which can be found <span><a href="privacy-policy.html">here</a></span>. All financial data you enter is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <h2>4. Widget and Notification Services</h2>
        <p>Moneyflow provides iOS widget functionality to display financial summaries on your home screen. Widget data is shared between the app and widget locally on your device through iOS App Groups. The app also provides local notification services for expense reminders, which are processed entirely on your device.</p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The content, features, and design available in Moneyflow are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse engineer any content from Moneyflow without our explicit written permission.</p>

        <h2>6. Financial Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Moneyflow is a personal finance tracking tool and does not provide financial advice. All financial data and insights are for informational purposes only. We are not responsible for any financial decisions you make based on information provided by the app.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Loss and Backup</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, uninstalling the app will permanently delete all your financial records. We recommend regularly exporting your data using the app's export features. Monthly data is automatically archived locally on your device for historical tracking purposes.</p>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to Moneyflow if you violate these Terms or engage in any activities that we consider harmful or inappropriate. Upon termination, your right to use the app will cease immediately, though your locally stored data will remain on your device.</p>

        <h2>9. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Moneyflow is provided "as is," without any warranties or guarantees of any kind, whether expressed or implied. We do not warrant that the app will be error-free or uninterrupted.</p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages resulting from your use or inability to use Moneyflow, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, and consequential damages, including data loss.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by posting the new Terms with an updated "Last Update" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Turkey. Any disputes arising from these Terms will be subject to the jurisdiction of Turkish courts.</p>
